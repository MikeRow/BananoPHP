## Repository contents

<br/>

## To do

- RPC 2.0 support (lib,ncm)
- IPC support (lib,ncm)

<br/>

## Discarded

- HTTP Callback

WebSocket is a better solution

- WebSocket

Since usage is pretty custom in each situation, I've decided to don't develop any class or ncm implementation<br/>
If you are looking for an easy way to implement a WebSocket client for PHP I suggest [Textalk/websocket-php](https://github.com/Textalk/websocket-php) repository
