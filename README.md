# php4nano

PHP libraries and tools for the Nano currency

<br/>

## Origins

php4nano is the evolution of the now archived [easyraikitphp](https://github.com/mikerow/easyraikitphp) repository.
The code has been rewritten from 0 in order to make it easier and faster for developers to use it, moreover the references to the previous name RaiBlocks have been replaced with the new, and better known Nano.

## Documentation

Full documentation is located in the [Wiki](https://github.com/mikerow/php4nano/wiki)
