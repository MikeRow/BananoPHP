# php4nano

PHP libraries and tools for the Nano currency

<br/>

## Origins

php4nano is the evolution of the now archived [easyraikitphp](https://github.com/mikerow/easyraikitphp) repository, which was used between 2016 and 2017 for the official RaiBlocks's block explorer and faucet hosted on [raiblockscommunity.net](https://raiblockscommunity.net)

The code has been rewritten from 0 in order to make it easier and faster for developers to use it, moreover the references to the previous name RaiBlocks have been replaced with the cooler, better known name Nano
